	<h3 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 40px;">&#9733; About</h3>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Liverblue District is a secret district only the people invited by Hualing can get into. The district was originally by made by Hualing and Hetansh to do astronomy research in peace, but later on as soon as they start inviting people, it's now a whatever district. The story revolves around the daily life of Hualing along with the other district denizens which is full of drama.</p>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;">&#9733; History</h3>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">First created on 24 February 2023, with Oxford as the first character to be created. I don't wanna say what Liverblue District initially was before due to some reasons but it was different from what it is today.</p>
